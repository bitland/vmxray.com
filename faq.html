<h4>What can I use VMXRay for?</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Say you have a VMWare disk image (.vmdk file) or a CD image (.iso file) on your desktop and would like to look at the files inside. Perhaps there are a couple of files you would like to extract. You could start the virtual machine to access its files (What was the damn administrator password again?), or install a bunch of utilities to let you mount the image as a filesystem. Or, you could use VMXray, which, being a pure web app, requires no installation at all</li>
    <li> You could also look at other filesystem dumps (FAT, ext2, NTFS) in various formats (qcow2, raw). We haven't tested all combinations.</li>
    <li> In theory, you can recover deleted photos from raw dumps of your camera's SD card. It might be a little slow, though.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What about the privacy of my data?</h4>
<p> <b>No data from your files is ever sent over the network.</b> The privacy of your data is assured for the simple reason that it never leaves your machine. VMXRay does all its magic completely inside your browser.</p>

<h4 id="browser-support">What browsers are supported?</h4>
<p> VMXRay uses bleeding edge HTML5 features like the FileReader API to access local files. Not all browsers support it, and even in those which do, API support is evolving. Currently, we know of the following browsers on which browsing of images and preview of files work:
<ol>
<li> Google Chrome 13+ (Mac OS X, Ubuntu) </li>
<li> Firefox 7+ (Mac OS X, Ubuntu)</li>
<li> Opera 11+ (Mac OS X)</li>
</ol>
Downloading of files works properly only on Chrome.
</p>
<h4>What file formats are supported?</h4>
<p> There are two formats to be aware of - the disk image format and the filesystem/volume manager. The unhelpful answer is: whatever disk image format is supported by QEMU and whatever filesystem format is supported by sleuthkit. A partial list of formats known to work is given below.
    <ul><li><b>Disk image formats:</b> Raw, VMDK (single file VMWare4), ISO.</li>
    <li><b>Filesystems:</b> ext2, FAT, NTFS.</li>
    </ul>
Popular formats which don't work yet include multi-file VMDKs, Linux filesystems on top of LVM. We hope to support many more in future.
</p>
<h4 id="slow">Why is it so slow?</h4>
<p> Actually, it is shockingly fast :) Think about it: an x86 emulator <i>in Javascript</i> booting a modern Linux kernel in under 10 seconds! Moore's law and Fabrice Bellard FTW!</p>
<p> But yes, moving data in and out of JSLinux is slow in wallclock terms. <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/jlfs">jlfs</a> transfers data at around 420 KB/sec. Previewing and saving files are the slowest operations, since they require a roundtrip: image data goes into JSLinux, file data comes out.</p>
<h4> It doesn't make progress beyond "Starting Linux web appliance" / It gets stuck indefinitely at "Opening folder"</h4>
<p> It is <a href="#slow">slow</a>, but if there is no progress for a minute or more, it is likely a bug somewhere, or browser incompatibility. Look at the error console on the browser. Send us a screenshot of the page and the error console, or better still, a fix :) </p>
<h4>Is it free?</h4>
<ul><li>All open source software modifications made by Coriolis are released under the same license as the original software, and under 2-clause BSD where new components were created.</li>
<li> JSLinux is &copy Fabrice Bellard and is currently not open source; it may not be rehosted, mirrored or used for commercial purposes. We source the emulator scripts directly from http://bellard.org </li>
</ul>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p> Briefly,
    <img src="images/vmxray-block.png" height="300" style="float: right"></img>
    <ul>
        <li>A Linux virtual machine runs inside your browser. This is <a href="http://bellard.org">Fabrice Bellard's</a> <a href="http://bellard.org/jslinux/tech.html">JSLinux</a>, an x86 emulator implemented in Javascript. We use a custom kernel and root filesystem.
        <li> We have developed a special filesystem, <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/jlfs">jlfs</a>, runs on the Linux virtual machine, and its browser-side counterpart (jlfs.js) enable Linux applications to access files via the HTML5 FileReader API. </li>
        <li> A <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/sleuthkit">fork</a> of <a href="http://www.sleuthkit.org/">Sleuthkit</a>, a filesystem forensics tool is run on the Linux virtual machine to provide directory and file data.</li>
        <li> A <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/elFinder">fork</a> of the beautiful <a href="http://elrte.org/elfinder">elFinder</a> is used to present a folder interface to the file system</li>
        <li> There is no server-side processing; everything happens within the browser. </li>
    </ul>
