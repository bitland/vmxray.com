<h4>What can I use VMXRay for?</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Say you have a VMWare disk image (.vmdk file) or a CD image (.iso file) on your desktop and would like to look at the files inside. Perhaps there are a couple of files you would like to extract. You could start the virtual machine to access its files (What was the damn administrator password again?), or install a bunch of utilities to let you mount the image as a filesystem. Or, you could use VMXray, which, being a pure web app, requires no installation at all</li>
    <li> You could also look at other filesystem dumps (FAT, ext2, NTFS) in various formats (qcow2, raw). We haven't tested all combinations.</li>
    <li> In theory, you can recover deleted photos from raw dumps of your camera's SD card. It might be a little slow, though.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What about the privacy of my data?</h4>
<p> <b>No data from your files is ever sent over the network.</b> The privacy of your data is assured for the simple reason that it never leaves your machine. VMXRay does all its magic completely inside your browser.</p>

<h4 id="browser-support">What browsers are supported?</h4>
<p> VMXRay uses bleeding edge HTML5 features like the FileReader API to access local files. Not all browsers support it, and even in those which do, API support is evolving. Currently, we know of the following browsers on which browsing of images and preview of files work:
<ol>
<li> Google Chrome 13+ (Mac OS X, Ubuntu) </li>
<li> Firefox 7+ (Mac OS X, Ubuntu)</li>
<li> Opera 11+ (Mac OS X)</li>
</ol>
Downloading of files works properly only on Chrome.
</p>
<h4>What file formats are supported?</h4>
<p> There are two formats to be aware of - the disk image format and the filesystem/volume manager. The unhelpful answer is: whatever disk image format is supported by QEMU and whatever filesystem format is supported by sleuthkit. A partial list of formats known to work is given below.
    <ul><li><b>Disk image formats:</b> Raw, VMWare single and multi-file VMDKs, QEMU/KVM QCOW2 (without encryption/compression), Virtualbox VDI, ISO.</li>
    <li><b>Filesystems:</b> ext2, ext3, FAT, NTFS.</li>
    </ul>
Popular formats which don't work yet include ext4 and Linux filesystems on top of LVM. We hope to support many more in future.
</p>
<h4> How do I feed it multi-file VMDKs? </h4>
<p> Select multiple files in the <b>Select Disk Image</b> dialog (Ctrl-click or Cmd-click). If your image is called WinXP, make sure you pick each and every one of the WinXP-s00<i>n</i>.vmdk files <b>and</b> the WinXP.vmdk file.</p>
<p> VMWare Fusion on the Mac represents the VM as a <a href="http://www.mactipsandtricks.com/articles/Wiley_HT_appBundles.lasso">bundle</a>, so you cannot use <b>Select Disk Image</b> for this purpose. Instead, use the Finder to locate and select your desired machine and use the Action menu (gear icon) to <b>Show Package Contents</b>. This will take you inside the bundle directory, where you can see the individual files (.vmdk, .vmx, .vmem etc.) which constitute the VM. You can now select all the VMDK components using Cmd-click. Now drag and drop them onto the vmxray.com page in your browser, on the welcome message or on the explorer window.</p>
<p> Drag and drop can be used on all platforms for single files as well.</p>
<h4>It reports unsuppoted file type or gets stuck indefinitely at "Opening folder"</h4>
<p>Currently, it only supports image files of size less than 4GB. The libc that comes with <a href="http://emscripten.org">emscripten</a> does not have support for large files.
<p> Also, if you are trying split disk files, make sure there are no spaces in file names.
<h4>Above FAQ is not your case and it gets stuck indefinitely at "Opening folder"</h4>
<p> It might be slow, but if there is no progress for a minute or more, it is likely a bug somewhere, or browser incompatibility. Look at the error console on the browser. Send us a screenshot of the page and the error console, or better still, a fix :) </p>
<h4>Is it free?</h4>
<ul><li>All open source software modifications made by <a href="http://www.coriolis.co.in">Coriolis</a> are released under the same license as the original software, and under 2-clause BSD where new components were created.</li>
<li> <a href="http://bellard.org/jslinux">JSLinux</a> is &copy Fabrice Bellard and is currently not open source; it may not be rehosted, mirrored or used for commercial purposes. We source the emulator scripts directly from http://bellard.org </li>
</ul>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p> Briefly,
    <ul>
        <li>A <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/sleuthkit">fork</a> of <a href="http://www.sleuthkit.org/">Sleuthkit</a>, a filesystem forensics tool is enhanced to understand virtual disk images like .vmdk, .vdi, .qcow2 etc. by making it use <a href="http://qemu.org">QEMU</a> library.
        <li>We compiled both  <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/sleuthkit">Sleuthkit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/QEMU">QEMU</a> to JS.
        <li>The <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/sleuthkit">Sleuthkit</a> tool is run as webworker that extracts file and folders information from the image file.
        <li>We have implemented LD_PRELOAD like hook for <i>pread</i> system call that reads actual file bits through HTML5 file reader APIs.</li>
        <li> A <a href="https://github.com/coriolis/elFinder">fork</a> of the beautiful <a href="http://elrte.org/elfinder">elFinder</a> is used to present a folder interface to the file system</li>
        <li> There is no server-side processing; everything happens within the browser. </li>
    </ul>
